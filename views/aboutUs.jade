          div(style="color:white; padding-right:100px; padding-left:100px; padding-bottom:5px;") The Urban Biodiversity Hub (UBHub) helps cities around the world to measure and promote their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy. We work with municipal and other local governments and their partners to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their biodiversity planning, according to the goals they set for themselves. We do this by consolidating information on urban biodiversity planning activities and guides in one website, and through our forum and other resources pages which provide access to the latest practices for urban biodiversity planning.

      div(style="width=100%; background:#07456b; color:white; text-align:center; padding:5px; font-size:22px; margin-top:15px") GOALS
      div(style="padding:10px") Our immediate goal is to create a web tool for local governments (cities) to measure their biodiversity and assess their biodiversity strategy. In the long term, we are looking to promote biodiversity awareness and action within and around cities due to future urban issues.

We have since built an international organizational structure that is maintained via regular online meetings and reliance on the latest in remote team management tools. <br><br> Our team consists of volunteers from around the world. Some are professionals in biodiversity, conservation policy, or web development, and others are passionate to learn and make a difference. We have representatives all around the world, allowing us to serve the specific regional needs and contributing in the development of best practices for urban biodiversity strategies.

        div(style="margin-top:5px;") The City of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada has a rich natural heritage. The North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravines System, known locally as the “Ribbon of Green”, winds through the city’s centre and, at 7,400 hectares, forms the largest municipally owned urban park in North America. On the flat tablelands above the river valley, forests and wetlands remain on the landscape among developed areas, and still support a relative diversity of wildlife. As Edmonton and surrounding communities continue to develop, there is a growing recognition of the need for regional collaboration to protect and restore the region’s natural systems.
      div <p>As outlined in Edmonton's Biodiversity Action Plan, the City's vision is to create "A system of conserved natural areas, ecologically and effectively managed, connecting the river valley with tableland natural areas, restored green spaces and regional natural areas, and recognized and supported by the community of Edmonton as a valued asset."<p>The City uses a range of conservation tools to protect and manage natural areas and biodiversity, including plans and policies that set high level strategic direction, planning tools like the dedication of reserve lands that protect habitats from development, management approaches that support the natural function of the landscape (e.g. wildlife connectivity analysis and wildlife passage design), and land purchase and donation programs, such as the Edmonton and Area Land Trust, that help to secure unprotected natural areas.<p>While Edmonton faces significant challenges in natural areas protection, including a rapidly growing economy and population base, limited municipal funds, and restricted legislative authority, it has achieved some important successes through strong partnerships, the support of committed volunteers, and high prioritization of environmental issues by City Council and citizens.

      +partner("images/UBILogo.jpg", "http://ubif.us/", "The Urban Biodiversity Inventory Framework (UBIF) was developed to guide and support cities in their efforts to successfully record, analyze, and assess biodiversity information in urban areas.  By providing a way to accurately and consistently assess biodiversity resources and track changes over time, the UBIF can assist cities in making appropriate management decisions to protect their ecological assets. The UBIF is a tool cities can use in the collection of biodiversity information to support proactive efforts to maintain and enhance urban biodiversity, as well as identify the need for response when species are declining. By applying the UBIF methodology, cities can monitor the response to actions, such as restoration activities, designed to enhance urban biodiversity. The UBIF structure also allows cities to record changes in urban biodiversity for a specific species, taxa group, or for multiple taxa in a specific habitat of interest. This flexibility provides information at different levels of organization and can also be used to generate a “report card” or summary score, aiding in the communication of biological information to diverse audiences.")
      +partner("images/logo_AIPH.png", "https://www.aiph.org", 'AIPH, the International Association of Horticultural Producers and the world’s champion for the power of plants, has, since 1948, united horticultural producers in an international community that thrives to this day. Much has changed in that time. Technologies advanced, cities rose from the ground, and we have become more connected than ever. As a result, our essential bond with nature has been weakened. Thus, AIPH strives to reignite and uphold an appreciation of plants that we believe is a basic human instinct. Nature is the foundation on which our increasingly urban lives depend. Through our Green City Programme, we promote the essential role of plants in creating vibrant urban areas and aim to develop an international standard for green cities as well as being a focal point for green city best practice and a source of expertise. We lead global thinking on the successful integration of nature into the built environment by supporting the bold and ambitious actions of local governments. The AIPH World Green City Awards is our flagship Green City initiative, with entries open every two years. These Awards are designed to champion ambitious nature-orientated approaches to city design and operation. Through our Green City work, we aim to inspire a global movement of local governments who are driving nature-orientated approaches to building greener, healthier, and more liveable cities that are fit for the future. By transforming cities into places where humans and nature can thrive harmoniously, we create an enabling environment for promoting urban initiatives which demonstrate the multiple benefits that plants and nature provide in response to the many challenges cities currently face, thereby contributing to sustaining our planet, for this generation and the next.')

He currently serves as a Research and Planning Analyst with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks in the area of source water protection where he helps to ensure that both groundwater and surface water bodies, which are sources of drinking water, are protected against potentially harmful activities on the landscape.
                div In addition to his professional career, Michael has and continues to be involved in a number of urban nature conservation projects. One of his first acts was to construct a native wildflower garden to serve as a refuge for monarch butterflies. Since then, he has been involved with the City of Toronto’s Community Stewardship Program and tasked with removing non-native, invasive species and planting native trees and shrubs in a City park. Working alongside other community members, he helped to plant over 200 native trees as part of the Leslieville Tree Project to renew the urban canopy in Toronto’s east end. The Leslieville Tree Project was formally recognized by the Ontario government through its June Callwood Award for Outstanding Voluntarism that is awarded to noteworthy community groups. He is currently a proud member of the Toronto Field Naturalists, a volunteer-supported urban nature conservation group, the goals of which are to learn about, enjoy, and to protect Toronto’s green spaces and the species that live within them.
